Built a Full-Stack Django Music Player from Scratch — Developed a backend-driven music player using Django and Python, handling audio uploads, database-backed song metadata, routing, and media serving. The frontend uses HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript with the HTML5 Audio API to deliver responsive playback controls and dynamic content rendering.
